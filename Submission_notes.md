# **HTML5 Assignment — PLP Web Development**

## Project Overview
This project is my submission for the **PLP Web Development HTML5 assignment**.  
It demonstrates the use of semantic HTML elements, multimedia integration, table creation, navigation links, and form validation.  
The goal was to apply best practices for structuring a web page while making it visually clear and functional.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Lists
- **Unordered List** (`<ul>`) — to display items without order.
- **Ordered List** (`<ol>`) — to display items in sequence.
- **Nested Lists** — combining ordered and unordered lists.

---

### 2. Table
A table with:
- Table headers (`<th>`)
- Table rows (`<tr>`)
- Table data cells (`<td>`)
- Proper structure with `<thead>` and `<tbody>`.

---

### 3. Media Elements
- **Images** — added with `alt` attributes for accessibility.
- **Linked Image** — image wrapped in an `<a>` tag to link to external resources.
- **GIF** — animated media demonstrating web processes.
- **Audio** — included using `<audio>` with controls and source tags.
- **Video** — embedded using `<video>` with controls.

---

### 4. Forms
- Text input, email input, password field (with validation patterns).
- Number input with min and max values.
- Radio buttons for gender selection.
- Checkboxes for multiple interest selections.
- Dropdown (`<select>`) for country choice with a disabled placeholder option.
- Textarea for a short bio.
- File upload for profile picture.
- Submit button with descriptive text.

---

### 5. Navigation & Sections
- Used semantic elements like `<section>` and `<h2>/<h3>` headings.
- Internal navigation with IDs for linking.

---

## HTML5 Best Practices Used
- `alt` attributes on all images for accessibility.
- Form validation with `required`, `pattern`, and type-specific inputs.
- Semantic tags (`<section>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<label>`).
- Fallback text for audio/video for unsupported browsers.
- Used forward slashes `/` for file paths instead of backslashes `\` for web compatibility.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding the `pattern` attribute in form validation.
- Positioning `<label>` and `<select>` correctly.
- Deciding whether to use `input type="image"` or `type="file"`.

---

## Folder Structure
```
/project-folder
│── index.html # Main HTML file
│── /media # Images, audio, video files
└── submission.md # This documentation
```

---

## How to View the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the `/media` folder contains all referenced files.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
4. Test form validation by trying invalid inputs.
